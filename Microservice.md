# INTRODUCTION
The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.

# Why Microservices?
Companies like Netflix, Amazon, and others have adopted the concept of microservices in their products. Microservices are one of the hottest topics in the software industry, and many organizations want to adopt them. Especially helpful is the fact that DevOps can play very well with microservices.

# What are microservices?
Microservices structures an application as a collection of services that are
> 1. Highly maintainable and testable
> 2. Loosely coupled
> 3. Independently deployable
> 4. Organized around business capabilities
> 5. Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
